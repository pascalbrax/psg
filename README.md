Easy and simple gallery in one single PHP file with (almost) zero-configuration.
*GD Library is required.*

Demo: http://mira.scavenger.ch/~pascal/psg/gallery.php

**Tips:**
* create a writable "cache" folder for browsing the images a bit faster.
* Download [pSimpleBox] and put ```psimplebox.js``` in the same folder to get a nice [Lighbox] style effect (**do NOT edit any file**).
