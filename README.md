Easy and simple gallery in one single PHP file with (almost) zero-configuration.

Demo: http://www.scavenger.ch/images/

**Installation:**
* Download ```gallery.php``` and put it in your images main folder on your webserver.
* Done.

**Requirements:**
* ```PHP``` version 5.3 at least.
* ```GD Library``` extension for PHP
* ```EXIF``` extension for PHP

**Optional:**
* Download [pSimpleBox] and put ```psimplebox.js``` in the same folder to get a nice [Lighbox] style effect (no need to edit any file).
* create a writable folder named ```cache``` for browsing the images a bit faster.
